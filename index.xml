When the War was over, my father refused to take down our blackout curtains for ages. Most of the curtains were removed right away, with some women transforming the leftover materials into dresses and skirts as quickly as they could. They heard rumours that the men wanted to burn them in a bonfire, so it was better that they stashed them away safely. That day, everyone had tuned into the radio to listen to Churchill finally announce that the War was over.</description></item><item><title>Victory Dance - Prologue</title><link>https://blog.lekwati.com/posts/victory-dance-prologue/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Mar 2021 12:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://blog.lekwati.com/posts/victory-dance-prologue/</guid><description>The war overseas may be over, but the war on our shores has just begun&amp;hellip;
